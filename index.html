        I'm an Anthropic Safety Fellow and fourth-year PhD student at MIT CSAIL, advised by
        <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/dhm/">Dylan Hadfield-Menell</a>.<br/><br/>

        I do pragmatic AI safety research with the hope of reducing catastrophic risks from powerful AI systems.<br/><br/>

        Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree at Johns Hopkins, where I worked with Professor
        <a href="http://vision.jhu.edu/rvidal.html">Rene Vidal</a> on the theory of deep learning.
        During undergrad, I also worked with <a href="https://www.dynotx.com/">Dyno Therapeutics</a> on ML-guided protein
        design.<br/><br/>

        Outside of work, I enjoy playing piano, backpacking, salsa dancing, and philosophy.<br/><br/>
