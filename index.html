        I am a first-year PhD student at MIT CSAIL, advised by
        <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/dhm/">Dylan Hadfield-Menell</a>.

        My research interests center on aligning AI systems — such as reinforcement learning systems
        and large language models — with human goals. I am also interested in the theoretical
        foundations of alignment and the intersection of machine learning and causality.<br/><br/>
        
        Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree at Johns Hopkins, where I worked with Professor
        <a href="http://vision.jhu.edu/rvidal.html">Rene Vidal</a> on the theory of deep learning.
        During undergrad, I also worked with <a href="https://www.dynotx.com/">Dyno Therapeutics</a> and NASA on biological
        sequence design using machine learning, combinatorial optimization, and quantum computing.<br/><br/>

        See my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Z9voXDgAAAAJ&hl=en">Google Scholar</a> for an up-to-date list of publications.
        <br/><br/>

        Outside of work, I enjoy playing piano, backpacking, salsa dancing, and philosophy.
