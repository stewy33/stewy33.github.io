        My name is Stewy Slocum. I'm a junior research scientist at the Johns Hopkins Vision
        Lab with <a href="http://www.cis.jhu.edu/~rvidal/">Rene Vidal</a>. My goal is to develop principled,
        mathematically-driven machine learning methods that are practically impactful.<br/><br/>

        My current research spans theoretical and practical aspects of optimization in deep learning,
        inspired by the continuous-time limits of optimization algorithms as dynamical systems.
        More recently, I started working on generative modeling and semantic representation learning.

        In the past, I've worked with <a href="https://www.dynotx.com/">Dyno</a> and NASA on biological sequence design
        using machine learning, combinatorial optimization, and quantum computing.
